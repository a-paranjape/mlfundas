# Fundamentals of Machine Learning

Modules implementing basic machine learning algorithms for classification and regression, including `Perceptron`, logistic regression, support vector machines and standard feed-forward neural network with error back-propagation using `stochastic gradient descent`.

All routines currently written as modules importable from `mllib`. Additionally, `utilities` provides various utility modules for i/o and simple tools.
